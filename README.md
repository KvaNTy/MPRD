# Multi-Product Recipe Details
Mod for Factorio.
Displays the list of all product names in recipe description if there are more then one product in the recipe. Becomes quite useful when recipes get rather complex (like in Angel's PetroChemical or Py's CoalProcessing) so you don't have to guess recipe output only by product icons.
